# HashMap

Goal of the project is to create association rules based on twitter hashtags. Hashtags are very valuable information. People and Brands use hashtags to arrange and organize data in social media so that it can be searched faster.

Background

Brands including individuals, need to know how are they percieved in the world. How and whom are they getting associated with and some kind of measure to tell them what that association means. When a brand builds a promotion #hashtag, they need to know how that is working. Stocks need to track with other stocks to see if changes in other stocks make a difference to their own values.

Way to do all this is through Associations and building rules around these associations.

Why use a Distributed Systems? Getting frequent patterns in the data. Associations highly rely on what hashtags are tweeted together. Frequent patters are highly computationally heavy. So use distributed systems to achieve it.
